\chapter{Epilogue}

\paragraph{September 12, 11:05; Fuzzy HQ}
Once again I am back were I left off.
I left a day of just doing nothing before I started picking up my life where I left it.
Got a bit dusty.

So, after unpacking, I have a pile of dirty laundry and a heap of souvenirs I have to offload somewhere.
And once again, not much changed during my absence.
So I dust off my life and get on with it.

Only thing I can not quite fathom\ldots{}
We did not bring a roll of toilet paper and we ended up not needing one.
Maybe Murphy is on his holidays as well.

This is Agent Fuzzy, signing off.
